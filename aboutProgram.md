(i) Take three integers, e, n (the public key for RSA), and m (the number of characters in the message) as
input to your program. Next, input the ciphertext.
(ii) Test whether the public key is valid. If not, output a single line “Public key is not valid!” and quit the
program.
(iv) If the public key is valid, decode the message.
(v) Output p and q, φ(n) and d.
(vi) On a new line, output the decoded message in integers.
(vii) On a new line, output the decoded message in English. The characters should be all uppercase. You
can assume that the numbers will be assigned to characters according to the mapping above: A is 3,
B is 4, ...
